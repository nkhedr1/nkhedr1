# 👋 Hi, I'm Nour

I'm a self-taught cybersecurity enthusiast and former software developer, now focused on offensive security, pentesting, and red teaming. I’ve been studying for the OSCP exam, completing hands-on labs across Hack The Box and Proving Grounds.

🔍 I enjoy digging into:
- Web application vulnerabilities
- Active Directory attacks
- Privilege escalation in Linux and Windows environments
- Adversary emulation and practical exploitation

📁 Check out my [Pentest Lab Writeups](https://github.com/nkhedr1/pentest-labs) for examples of real-world techniques and walkthroughs.

I'm passionate about security, committed to growth, and excited to keep learning and contributing to the field.
